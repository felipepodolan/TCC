# TCC

This is the repository for my graduation final project written in LaTeX and using [CoppeTex](http://coppetex.sourceforge.net/index.html).

## Instalation

If you're in a Mac, you'll need [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) and a LaTeX editor of your preference.

I recommend [TeXnicle](http://www.bobsoft-mac.de/texnicle/texnicledownload/texnicledownload.html).

You also will need [CoppeTex](http://coppetex.sourceforge.net/index.html).

## Runing

Clone the project

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/felipepodolan/TCC
```

Import the project in your editor and run.
