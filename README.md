# TCC

This is the repository for my graduation final project written in ```TeX``` and using [CoppeTex](http://coppetex.sourceforge.net/index.html) standart as template.

## Prerequisites

If you're in a Mac, download and install [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/).

Windows and Linux have their own distributions of ```LaTeX```.

For Mac users, I recommend [TeXnicle](http://www.bobsoft-mac.de/texnicle/texnicledownload/texnicledownload.html) as a ```LaTeX``` editor.

## Running

Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/felipepodolan/TCC
```

Import the project in your prefered ```LaTeX``` editor and run it. It should produce the final pdf.
